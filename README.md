# Correlating Accuracy in Importance Sampling with Human Screening Efforts

## Overview
The [original DISCount paper](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/30235/32198&ved=2ahUKEwjXsNqetZSNAxW5v4kEHfrFK1sQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3kk13bCds4pSS-YqoQynOx) introduced at the start of the program reports that importance sampling reduces the need for manual labeling by a factor of 9 to 12. This observation raises an important question: to what extent does manual labeling remain necessary after applying DISCount, and is there a measurable correlation between the proportion of labeled data and the resulting accuracy? This research has two potential implications. If the post-DISCount labeling effort proves minimal, the vision model can be reliably deployed with high confidence. Conversely, if labeling remains a significant factor, identifying the optimal trade-off between labeling effort and accuracy will be critical to developing an efficient annotation strategy.
This Github repository includes the implementation and evaluation of importance sampling (DISCount) estimation on an output generated by a computer vision model.

## Features
* DISCount-based iterative object counting
* Comparison with Monte Carlo (uniform) and triangle sampling
* Visualizations and statistical plots

## Pre-Usage
Everything you need to know before starting:
* The entire code is written in Python. Try to be familiar with Python.
* We use numpy, matplotlib, pyplot, and pandas. Knowing the syntax will get you a head start.
* Use [this website](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via_demo.html) for annotations.

## Usage
### Step 1: Import image and computer vision model output
* The default method is adding the image (.jpg/.png), the annotation file (.json), and the computer vision model output (.npy) locally, then replace the path in the setup section.
* Remember to specify the labeling method (bounding boxes/single points).

### Step 2: Set up tile size
* The tile size can be set up (in pixels). The program will print out the corresponding number of tiles per column, row, and the total tiles over the image.

### Step 3: Follow the instructions in the code
* The rest of the implementation is clearly explained in the sections of the Jupiter Notebook file.
* Feel free to import our work locally and be flexible with any features with your data.
